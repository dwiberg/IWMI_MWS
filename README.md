# IWMI_MWS
Code for Arduino-based Weather Station variants developed at IWMI

This repository contains code written by David Wiberg for variants of IWMI's arduino-based mobile weather stations: 
http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/resources/mobile-weather-stations/

The code is based off of the code from the various board manufacturers and the earlier work of Yann Chemin and others
associated with IWMI and advancing mobile weather stations in Sri Lanka:

This readme will be updated with more information over time. For now, this repository is mainly used for code that is being tested, although the directories with dates indicate code actually installed on devices in the field at that time.
